# Division

## Scenario: Division by 0 when operand 1 is any number

  When we enter first non zero operand.
  And we divide it with 0.
  
  Then it gives infinity as a result.
  
## Scenario: Divide 0 by any number

  When we enter first operand as 0.
  And we divide it with any number.
  
  Then it gives 0 as a result.
  
## Scenario: Division when both operands are 0

  When both operands are 0 in division.
  
  Then result is also zero.
  
## Scenario: Recurring decimal case

  When the result of division is recurring.
  That is after decimal large number occurs.
  
  Then round off after 2 decimal digits.
  
## Scenario: Manny times "/" occurs

  When many times / operator occurs in division.
  
  Then only consider one divide operator between two operands.
  And if after / operator no any operand is present.
  Then neglect that / operator.
